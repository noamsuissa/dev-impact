# dev-impact 

> A new standard in showcasing developer impact. Out with the old resumes that end up nowhere.

## Motivation

Traditional resumes are static documents that rarely capture the true impact of a developer's work. They get lost in the pile, forgotten in inboxes, and fail to tell the compelling story of what you've actually built and achieved.

**dev-impact** changes this. It's a platform for developers to showcase their real impact through:
- Quantifiable metrics that matter
- Clear problem-solution narratives
- Beautiful, shareable profiles at `dev-impact.io/your-username`
- Easy export to multiple formats
- Public profile links to share with anyone

Show your work. Show your impact. Stand out.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- A GitHub account
- Cloud or [Self-hosted](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) Supabase

### Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both the `backend` and `frontend` folders and fill in the required values. You’ll need to provide your Supabase keys and set the correct redirect URLs.


> Make sure to set `AUTH_REDIRECT_URL` to your frontend’s password reset route (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/reset-password`).

---

Once your `.env` files are ready, continue with the Backend and Frontend setup below!

### Database Migrations (Supabase)

Apply the migrations in the `backend/migrations` folder *in order* using the Supabase SQL editor:

1. Open your Supabase project and go to the "SQL Editor".
2. Start with the lowest migration number (e.g., `001_...`), open the file, and paste its contents into the SQL editor.
3. Run the SQL snippet.
4. Repeat for each next migration (`002_...`, `003_...`, etc.), **in order**, until all migrations are applied.

This will set up the database tables and policies required for dev-impact to work!



### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The backend API will run at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173`

### Quick Start

1. Start both backend and frontend servers (see above)
2. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
3. Click "Get Started" and complete onboarding
4. Connect your GitHub account (optional but recommended)
5. Start building your impact profile!
6. Click "Publish Profile" to get a shareable link!

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions 🫶! Here's how you can help:

### Reporting Issues
- Found a bug? Open an issue with details and steps to reproduce.
- Have a feature idea? Share it in the issues with the "enhancement" label.

### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-impact.git
   cd dev-impact
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   - Make sure your fork is up to date with the upstream repository. By default, all contributions should branch from the `dev` branch (not `main`, which is production).
   - Add the upstream remote and fetch the latest branches:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/noamsuissa/dev-impact.git
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout dev
     git pull upstream dev
     ```
   - Create your feature or fix branch from `dev`:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
     ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Backend: Follow FastAPI best practices.
   - Frontend: Keep the terminal aesthetic consistent.
   - Write clear commit messages.

4. **Test your changes**
   - Ensure backend starts without errors.
   - Verify frontend functionality works.
   - Check that existing features aren't broken.

5. **Submit a pull request**
   - Push your branch to your own fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feat/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a pull request **from your fork’s feature branch to the `dev` branch on the main repository**.
   - Describe what you changed and why.
   - Reference any related issues.
   - Wait for review and feedback.

> **Note:** Only maintainers merge to `main` (connected to the production platform). Please always PR into `dev`.

### Development Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns and conventions.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive messages (e.g., "feat: add GitHub OAuth", "fix: dashboard rendering").
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs if you change functionality.
- **Testing**: Manually test your changes before submitting.
